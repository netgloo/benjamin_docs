### Build Tool

#### Use a build tool

Splitting the javascript file on multiple files requires to include each javascript file in your head. 

A more practical solution is to use a build tool to concatenate all javascript files in one `main.js` file, than include only this one. The build tool solution will improve the website performance also, reducing the number of http request needed to get all your javascript files and allowing javascript's minimization.

Note that you can use a build tool also if you have only a single javascript file.
